  - Ya know, I never expect to see another living creature here..
  - If could, would you help me keep an eye out for a red whale?
  - He's my brother, if you see him please tell him I'm alive
  - let him not worry. I'm safe.
  - That old guy, he has almost lost his mobility. But he promised to save me.
